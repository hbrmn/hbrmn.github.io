A thorough understanding of network former roles in optical glasses and glass-ceramics, as well as structural environments of luminescent rare-earth atoms, is paramount to assessing their suitability and effectiveness as components for fully-optical integrated devices. The present contribution sheds light on the overall poorly understood structural role of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in oxide glasses and offers a rationale for the luminescence changes concomitant to the heat-treatment induced glass-to-crystal transition in niobium germanate glasses. To this end, results from <sup>93</sup>Nb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman, and Eu3+ ion based luminescence spectroscopies as well as 3D micromanufacturing are reported for glasses and glass-ceramics in system (89.9-x)GeO<sub>2</sub>-xNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-10K<sub>2</sub>O-0.1Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Thanks to very-fast <sup>93Nb</sup> magic-angle spinning (MAS) and a novel excitation scheme for Triple-quantum (TQ)MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy distinct Nb(OGe)<sub>6-y</sub>(ONb)<sub>y</sub> species were identified for the first time: at low Nb concentrations structural units with rather low y-values are formed, reaching down to isolated Nb(OGe)<sub>6</sub> units – next to units bearing non-bridging oxygen atoms; at intermediate Nb contents and beyond, structural units with increasingly higher y-values up to Nb(ONb)<sub>6</sub> are found, resembling the local environments found in crystalline Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. After the glass-to-crystal transition the Nb local environment maintains a high degree of disorder while some residual glass remains. Moreover, photoluminescence spectroscopy of the europium probes suggests the rare-earth ions are preferentially incorporated into high y-value Nb(OGe)<sub>6-y</sub>(ONb)<sub>y</sub> polyhedra based on spectral features such as the phonon sideband, the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> → <sup>7</sup>F<sub>2</sub>/<sup>7</sup>F<sub>1</sub> ratio, and split 4f bands. Finally, femtosecond laser microfabrication of waveguides was successful in the presented europium-doped niobium germanate glasses, making them promising candidates for further studies as photonic devices.
