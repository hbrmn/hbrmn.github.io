This study investigates the bioactivity and microstructural properties of borate-based bioactive 13-93B3 glass
produced by the solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method using urea and sucrose fuels at different reaction
temperatures. The results show these glasses exhibit unique properties compared to conventionally-synthesized
borate-based bioactive glasses. The glass particles produced have porous surfaces, with particle sizes below 100
nm. BET measurements reveal that the mesoporous structure of these glasses is characterized by high-specific
surface areas, promoting a high ion release and hydroxyapatite layer formation in simulated body fluid (SBF).
The crystallization of the amorphous calcium phosphate was investigated by <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>31</sup>P MAS, and 2D <sup>31</sup>P{<sup>1</sup>H}
heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectroscopy, showing that it progresses linearly up to three days. The
produced glasses were tested for their effects on the viability of 3T3 cells and were found to have no toxic effects.
Therefore, the produced glasses are promising candidates for tissue engineering applications.
