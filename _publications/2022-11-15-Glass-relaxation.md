Structural rearrangements taking place during relaxation and crystal nucleation in lithium-disilicate (LS2) glass have been investigated by a comprehensive set of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Samples were subjected to heat treatments at 435 °C, i.e., 20 K below the laboratory glass transition temperature (T~g~). Raman and NMR data indicate that under these conditions both relaxation and nucleation occur without detectable changes in the network former unit distribution of the glassy silicon-oxide network. Instead, relaxation of the frozen supercooled melt and nucleation of LS2 crystals occur principally in terms of a changing lithium local environment: <sup>7Li</sup> spin-echo decay NMR indicates average Li-Li distances, characterized by homonuclear dipolar second-moment measurements, are reduced after very short heat treatments and approach those found in the isochemical crystal. This finding is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predicting a dependence of the Li<sup>+</sup> ion distribution on the melt-cooling rate. In addition, the structural reorganization also impacts the distribution of electric field gradients as detected by <sup>Li</sup> satellite transition NMR spectroscopy. Finally, crystal nucleation becomes most evident by the appearance of minor amounts of sharp <sup>29</sup>Si MAS resonances and a significant change in the <sup>7</sup>Li NMR satellite transitions, as visualized by difference spectroscopy. This study defines a new NMR strategy, generally applicable for investigating the structural relaxation process accompanying the internal crystallization of ion-conducting frozen supercooled melts containing suitable NMR active nuclear probes (<sup>7</sup>Li, <sup>23</sup>Na, <sup>133</sup>Cs, etc.).
