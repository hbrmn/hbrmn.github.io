Here, I will demonstrate how to setup a WCPMG experiment and lay out the usual thought process when deciding which parameters to use.

But first, a quick recap on CPMG experiments:

The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiment extends a simple Hahn echo experiment by recording several echoes within a single experiment, quickly alternating between the pulse gating and signal acquisition. This way, by superimposing all measured free-induction decays (FIDs) and subsequent Fourier transformation (FT), a regular frequency spectrum can be obtained.
