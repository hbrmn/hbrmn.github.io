About
======

Hi! My name is Henrik Bradtmüller and I am a Materials Scientist with a background in chemistry and specialization in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Münster, in the Department of Physical Chemistry.

My main research

My main research interests are the development of novel
[comment]: # ( When looking at most modern human--tech interfaces, like smartphones, TV- and computer-screens, or even in surgical robotics, we are looking at glass literally 100% of the time without perceiving it. Especially for smartphones, the role of glass is vital in the user experience as we feel it with every of our interactions. In contrast to the subtleness of its presence the creation of suitable glasses for electronic devices requires careful control of all glass substituents and the manufacturing conditions. Scientific research has shown over decades that it is possible to tune the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of glasses in a very detailed manner and that even subtle compositional changes may lead to drastic differences in glasses. Therefore, the study of glasses requires great care and detail in experimental preparations, theoretical aspects, data handling and interpretation.)

[comment]: # (During my years in glass reseach, it was therefore that I have developed a very analytical eye inspired by the scientific process that sparked my interest for data science. After researching and understanding individual glass-systems, data science is the next logical step to study many related glass-systems bringing about insights onto the meta level.)
