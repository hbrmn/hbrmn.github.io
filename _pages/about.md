About
======

Hi! I'm Henrik Bradtmüller, a Materials Scientist with a background in chemistry and specialization in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Federal University of São Carlos in the Vitrous Materials Lab (LaMaV) of Prof. Dr. Edgar Dutra Zanotto. If I can't be found in the lab I am probably somewhere near the next coffee machine (at home - due to the pandemic...).

My research interest
======
I am currently researching the structural changes that occur during the relaxation and crystallization (or devitrification) of glasses in order to understand what aspects govern the survival or death of the vitreous state - because, once the first crystal nucleus is born, the crystallization of glass is a spontaneous and unstoppable process. Even after decades of research on this topic, many questions concerning the mechanisms and kinetics of the crystallization process remain still unsolved, yet they are of fundamental importance to glass science and all technology that sprung from it.

In order to fully grasp the importance of understanding the stability of glasses, it helps to look around and realize that glasses have become indispensable to most modern technology and to our everyday life. Probably the majority of humanity looks at glasses and interacts with them for a significant proportion of their day: for example when looking at most human--tech interfaces like smartphones or TV- and computer screens, but also when looking through traditional interfaces like the windshield of a car, windows, or the lense(s) of your camera - not to mention those people who use glasses in any sort of visual aid like glasses or contact lenses. And even when we are not directly looking through or at glasses, they still surround us everywhere and, for example, make sure that our internet is fast and reliable.

But this is not the end of it: extensive scientific and corporate trial-and-error research constantly supplies us with new types of glasses and so far we were able to tune the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of glasses in a manifold of detailed manners.

My current work
======
The advancement of fundamental glass research stands in strong contrast to the rapid discovery of new glasses and happens significantly more slowly. Historically, significant leaps forward in the understanding of glass structure were typically only made upon discovering completely new analytical methods, which often took years or even decades to occur. Among all methods, especially the advent of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has advanced the field significantly, as with this method it is possible to probe the disordered structure of glasses on the atomic level.

Recent research suggests that information on the ordering at the intermediate-range scale (ordering on a length scale of about 3 to 5 Å) may be decisive to how a glass crystallizes. Unfortunately, structural information on this length scale are particularly difficult to obtain for glass network modifiers (often alkaline or alkaline-earth oxides like Li<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O, CaO, MgO...), even with NMR spectroscopy.

Therefore, my main research is focused on developing novel characterization strategies for glasses by pushing the boundaries of the current state-of-the-art methods of solid-state NMR spectroscopy. This involves mainly getting a grip on spectroscopically challenging quadrupolar nuclei, to which most glass network modifiers count.

Other scientific interests
======
After researching and understanding many individual glass-systems via the trial-and-error approach, to me, data science appears to be the next logical step to gain insights on the meta level and accelerate the development of new glasses with interesting properties. Machine learning and neural network models, which already help businesses and research to improve their performance, are already finding their way into the realm of glass research.[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359645420300720#!)

[comment]: # (During my years in glass reseach, it was therefore that I have developed a very analytical eye inspired by the scientific process that sparked my interest for data science.  which is discussed mainly on three characteristic length-scales: short-range order (SRO), intermediate-range order (IRO), and medium-range order (MRO). These regimes respectively span the first, second- and third [my Github repository](https://github.com/hbrmn).)
