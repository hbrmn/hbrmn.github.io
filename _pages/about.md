This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Glass is technology
======
When looking at most modern human--tech interfaces, like smartphones, TV- and computer-screens, or even in surgical robotics, we are looking at glass literally 100% of the time without perceiving it. Especially for smartphones, the role of glass is vital in the user experience as we feel it with every of our interactions. In contrast to the subtleness of its presence the creation of suitable glasses for electronic devices requires careful control of all glass substituents and the manufacturing conditions. Scientific research has shown over decades that it is possible to tune the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of glasses in a very detailed manner and that even subtle compositional changes may lead to drastic differences in glasses. Therefore, the study of glasses requires great care and detail in experimental preparations, theoretical aspects, data handling and interpretation.

[comment]: # (During my years in glass reseach, it was therefore that I have developed a very analytical eye inspired by the scientific process that sparked my interest for data science. After researching and understanding individual glass-systems, data science is the next logical step to study many related glass-systems bringing about insights onto the meta level.)

Glass research
======
The research of glasses typically follows these steps:
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
