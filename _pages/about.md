About
======

Hi! I'm Henrik Bradtmüller, a Materials Scientist with a background in chemistry and specialization in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
Currently I work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Münster, in the Department of Physical Chemistry. If I can't be found in the lab I am probably somewhere near the next coffee machine...

My work and research
======
I am currently researching the structural changes that ocurr during the relaxation and crystallization of glasses in order to understand what decides about the survival or death of the vitreous state - because, once the first crystal nucleus is born, the crystallization of a glass is a spontaneous and unstoppable process. Even after decades of research on this topic many questions concerning the mechanisms and kinetics of the crystallization process remain still unsolved, yet they are of fundamental importance to glass science and all technology that sprung from it.
In order to fully grasp the importance of this problem, it helps to look around and realize that glasses have become indispensible to most modern technology and to our every day life. Probably the majority of the world's population looks at glasses and interacts with them for a significant proportion of their day: for example when looking at most human--tech interfaces like smartphones or TV- and computer-screens, but also when looking through traditional interfaces like the windshield of a car, windows, or the lense(s) of your camera - not to mention those people who use glasses in any sort of visual aid like glasses or contact lenses. And even when we are not directly looking through or at glasses, they still surround us everywhere and, for example, make sure that your internet is fast and reliable in form of glass-fibers.

As can be seen, thanks to scientific and corporate research, ways were found to tune the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of glasses in a manifold of detailed manners. It was found that often even subtle compositional changes may lead to drastic differences in glasses. Therefore, the study of glasses requires great care and eye for detail.

While extensive trial-and-error research constantly supplies us with new glasses, fundamental glass research in general advance much more slowly. Historically, significant leaps forward were typically only made upon the discovery of new analytical methods that could be exploited to probe the structure of glass. All that research has lead to our current understanding of glass structure.

However, recent advances in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has enabled us to expand the scope


Therefore, my main research interests are the development of novel

[comment]: # (During my years in glass reseach, it was therefore that I have developed a very analytical eye inspired by the scientific process that sparked my interest for data science. After researching and understanding individual glass-systems, data science is the next logical step to study many related glass-systems bringing about insights onto the meta level. which is discussed mainly on three characteristic length-scales: short-range order (SRO), intermediate-range order (IRO), and medium-range order (MRO). These regimes respectively span the first, second- and third)
