About Me
======

Hello there! I’m Henrik Bradtmüller, a Materials Scientist with a strong foundation in chemistry and a passion for uncovering the atomic-level mysteries of glassy materials. My expertise lies in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a powerful tool for probing disordered structures and advancing materials science in both academic and industrial applications.

Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Federal University of São Carlos, where I was part of the Vitreous Materials Lab (LaMaV) under the guidance of Professor Dr. Edgar Dutra Zanotto. There, I deepened my understanding of glass science while contributing to cutting-edge research on crystallization mechanisms and glass stability.

As of 2025, I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve transitioned into a new role as an Assistant Professor of Physics at the São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC), part of the University of São Paulo (USP). In this position, I’ll continue pushing the boundaries of materials characterization while expanding my research into bioactive glasses and their composition-structure-property relationships.

I’m deeply committed to using my skills to solve fundamental scientific challenges and develop innovative technologies. Thank you for visiting my website — feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or learn more about my work!

My research interest
======
Glasses are among the most versatile yet least understood materials. Despite their ubiquity — from smartphone screens to optical fibers — key questions about their atomic structure, stability, and crystallization behavior remain unanswered. My research seeks to unravel these mysteries, particularly focusing on:

1. The vitreous state and its collapse: What atomic-scale factors determine whether a glass survives or crystallizes? Once nucleation begins, crystallization becomes inevitable—yet we still lack a complete picture of the mechanisms driving this process.

2. Network modifiers in glasses: Alkali and alkaline-earth oxides (e.g., Li<sup>2</sup>O, Na<sup>2</sup>O, CaO) play critical roles in glass properties, but their intermediate-range ordering (~3–5 Å) is notoriously difficult to probe. My work develops advanced solid-state NMR strategies to tackle these challenges, especially for quadrupolar nuclei.

3. Bioactive glasses: In my new role at IFSC/USP, I’m expanding my focus to composition-structure-property relationships in bioactive glasses. By combining NMR with computational methods, I aim to design next-generation materials for medical and technological applications.

Understanding glass stability isn’t just academically fascinating — it’s essential for the technologies underpinning modern life. From faster internet via optical fibers to biomedical implants, glasses are irreplaceable. By refining our atomic-scale knowledge, we can unlock new functionalities and applications for this extraordinary material.

My current work
======
Historically, breakthroughs in glass science have relied on the development of entirely new analytical techniques — a slow and unpredictable process. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy revolutionized the field by enabling atomic-level insights into disordered structures, but significant gaps remain, particularly for network-modifying elements.

My research bridges these gaps by:

1. Developing novel NMR methods to study quadrupolar nuclei (e.g., <sup>23Na</sup>, <sup>27Al</sup>, <sup>17O</sup>), which are abundant in glass modifiers but difficult to analyze.

2. Integrating computational modeling with experimental data to decode structure-property relationships in bioactive and functional glasses.

3. Collaborating across disciplines to translate fundamental discoveries into real-world applications, from durable materials to biomedical devices.

At IFSC/USP, I’m excited to build a research program that merges NMR spectroscopy with emerging computational tools, fostering innovation in glass science while training the next generation of materials researchers.
