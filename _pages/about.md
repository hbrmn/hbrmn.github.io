About
======

Hi! I'm Henrik Bradtmüller, a Materials Scientist with a background in chemistry and specialization in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
Currently I work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Münster, in the Department of Physical Chemistry. If I can't be found in the lab I am probably somewhere near the next coffee machine...

My research interest
======
I am currently researching the structural changes that ocurr during the relaxation and crystallization (or devitrification) of glasses in order to understand what decides about the survival or death of the vitreous state - because, once the first crystal nucleus is born, the crystallization of a glass is a spontaneous and unstoppable process. Even after decades of research on this topic many questions concerning the mechanisms and kinetics of the crystallization process remain still unsolved, yet they are of fundamental importance to glass science and all technology that sprung from it.

In order to fully grasp the importance of understanding the stability of glasses, it helps to look around and realize that glasses have become indispensible to most modern technology and to our every day life. Probably the majority of humanity looks at glasses and interacts with them for a significant proportion of their day: for example when looking at most human--tech interfaces like smartphones or TV- and computer-screens, but also when looking through traditional interfaces like the windshield of a car, windows, or the lense(s) of your camera - not to mention those people who use glasses in any sort of visual aid like glasses or contact lenses. And even when we are not directly looking through or at glasses, they still surround us everywhere and, for example, make sure that our internet is fast and reliable.

But this is not the end of it: extensive scientific and corporate trial-and-error research constantly supplies us with new types of glasses and so far we were able to tune the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of glasses in a manifold of detailed manners.

My current work
======
The advancement of fundamental glass research stands in strong contrast to the rapid discovery of new glasses and happens significantly more slowly. Historically, significant leaps forward in the understanding of glass structure were typically only made upon discovering completely new analytical methods, which often took years or even decades. Especially the advent of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has advanced the field significantly, as with this method it is possible to probe the disordered structure of glasses on the atomic level.

Recent research suggests that information of the ordering on the intermediate-range scale (ordering on a length scale of about 3 to 5 Å) may be decisive to how a glass crystallizes. Unfortunately, structural information on this length scale are particularly difficult to obtain for glass network modifiers (often alkaline or alkaline-earth oxides like Li<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O, CaO, MgO...), even with NMR spectroscopy.

Therefore, my main research is focused on developing novel characterization strategies for glasses by pushing the boundaries of the current state-of-the-art methods of solid-state NMR spectroscopy. This involves mainly getting a grip on spectroscopically challenging quadrupolar nuclei, to which most glass network modifiers count.

[comment]: # (During my years in glass reseach, it was therefore that I have developed a very analytical eye inspired by the scientific process that sparked my interest for data science. After researching and understanding individual glass-systems, data science is the next logical step to study many related glass-systems bringing about insights onto the meta level. which is discussed mainly on three characteristic length-scales: short-range order (SRO), intermediate-range order (IRO), and medium-range order (MRO). These regimes respectively span the first, second- and third)
